# Zim exchange rates
 A visual of the Zimbabwean dollar's tumbling exchange rate

## Find my page here. https://bennett-gpj.github.io/Zimbabwe-exchange-rates/

I wanted to visualize the experience of someone living in Zimbabwe and checking the daily changes in the exchange rate. I've been following the economic situation closely since 2018 when I began working at Global Press Journal, as several of my colleagues live and work in the country. This project was meant to serve as data analysis/pre-reporting, skills-building and will eventually supplement our coverage on the topic (click the link below to see award-winning graphic-novel-style piece from 2019 which I worked heavily on).

__Questions I explored:__
- What does the trend look like for the Zimbabwe dollar's official exchange rate?
- How does that compare to the black market trend?
- What are the dates of important policy changes and how did they affect the exchange rates?
- Are there any patterns?

__Data collection methods:__
- I used the historical exchange rate data collected by researchers at Zimpricecheck.com
- I coded the data to show whether the exchange rate increased, decreased or stayed the same since the previous release
- With D3, I loaded this data onto an svg and drew lines & rectangles on top of the svg to highlight specific dates

__Skills I learned:__
- How to draw with D3
- How to load data to an svg created with D3
- How to create text boxes in Adobe Illustrator and load them on a page
- How to arrange a background image
- How to animate an svg with D3 (transitions)

__If I had more time, I would explore:__
- The impact of other important dates, policy changes, etc.
- Compare the inflation trends and the exchange rate trends
